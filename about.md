![Lauri and Brownie](images/facetime.png){:width="50%"}

Brownie is a 2013 Stanford graduation bear. Lauri is a bear from Australia who loves to travel.
Jean and JJ met Lauri at the Sydney Airport in 2017 and thought that she'd be a great partner for Brownie.
Lauri made a long and difficult journey to the US a year later.
Ever since then, Brownie and Lauri have become inseparable (except when Brownie is greedy and wants all the food for himself).
