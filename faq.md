## FAQ


#### Where did the cute bear logo come from?!
Jean's product designer friend, the amazing and talented <a href="http://carolynsun.com/">Carolyn Sun</a>, was kind enough to make us a logo.

#### Can I bring pets?
We love pets! However, we ask you to keep your pets at home if possible. Our dog Pocky will be at the event and she is a bit nervous around other dogs.

#### How are you making the event COVID-safe?
We plan to hold the event mostly outdoors (in Jean's parents' backyard). Our caterer's team is fully vaccinated, and they have hosted multiple weddings following all CDC and city guidelines. We also plan to have smaller tables and space them out to provide more room between individuals.

#### Thanks for inviting me, but I don't feel comfortable attending an in-person event yet.
That's no problem at all! Please don't feel obliged to attend if you're uncomfortable. We can catch up separately over Zoom or in a smaller setting. :-)
