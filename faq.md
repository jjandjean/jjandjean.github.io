## FAQ

#### Where is the wedding registry?

It does not exist.
Instead, we ask that you donate the money you would have spent on a wedding gift.
We plan to bring some jars to the wedding, each labeled with a charity that we support.
You can then drop money into the jar of your choice.
We promise to donate 100% of the money to the charity.

#### What should I wear?
Casual (think sundress, comfy shoes, etc)! You'll be outside on the grass most of the time.
Bring an outerlayer in case it gets a bit chilly.
If you want to play in the bouncy castle, make sure you wear something you can jump around in.
