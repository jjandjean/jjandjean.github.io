## FAQ


#### Where did the cute bear logo come from?!
Jean's product designer friend, the amazing and talented <a href="http://carolynsun.com/">Carolyn Sun</a>, was kind enough to make us a logo.

### Can I bring pets?
We love pets! However, we ask you to keep your pets at home if possible. Our dog Pocky will be at the event and she is a bit nervous around other dogs.
